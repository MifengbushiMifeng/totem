2.0 - Mon Jan 30, 2006
----------------------
    * TOTEM has now a TOTEM-base XML Schema defining common stuff for all XML
      schemas.
    * Some improvements to traffic matrices generation from Netflow traces:
      sampling rate and gzipped files.
    * Some changes to the traffic matrix schema (see the changelog inside the
      XML Schema).
    * the toolbox uses a listeners architecture: objects can register themselves
      to receive notification of events : domain notifications (add Lsp, remove
      node, ...), interDomain notifications (new domain loaded, default domain
      changed, domain unloaded), traffic matrix notifications (new traffic
      matrix loaded, default tm changed, tm unloaded), algorithm notifications
      (new algo started, algo stopped).
    * integrate new algorithms:
        - XAMCRA from TUDelft (NL)
        - MIRA and NEWMIRA from UNINA (IT)
        - REOPT and LSPDimensioning from FTW (Vienna, AT)
        - SAMTE (written by Fabian Skivï¿½e, RUN, BE)
    * added multiple instances capability for DAMOTE
    * CSPF can now compute efficiently paths from all sources to a destination
    * add the charts creation capability from scenario, output format can be
      EPS, PNG or JPEG.
    * New scenario events:
        - listShortestPaths
        - ECMPAnalysis
    * big GUI improvements:
        - IGPWO integration
        - multiple domains management
        - multiple traffic matrices management
        - compute LSP and fullmesh with chosen algorithm
        - can save network visualization as PNG image
        - can create charts
        - can load and execute scenarios (step-by-step execution)
        - view logging output in a console window
    * upgrade to JFreeChart 1.0.0
    * Lots of bugfixes


1.1 - Wed May 18, 2005
----------------------
    * hierarchical XML schema to support XML element declaration in multiple
      schema. Each method can define its own scenario events schema
    * inter domain traffic matrix for representing prefix to prefix traffic
    * Netflow traffic matrix generated using Netflow and BGP data
    * multiple traffic matrix support in IGP-WO and new parameters
    * ECMP support in the SPF
    * GUI improvements
    * integration of Bhandari K Disjoint Shortest path algorithm
    * NetController is a new component which listens to the events occurring on
      a network and which reacts in some way to these events. Ex. automatic LSP
      rerouting strategy.
    * upgrade to JAXB 1.0.4
    * upgrade to Jung 1.6
