The TOTEM toolbox provides a framework for traffic engineering methods where researchers can integrate their algorithms.
These algorithms can therefore be applied on models of real networks. The TOTEM toolbox also gives network
operators the opportunity to experiment the currently developed traffic engineering algorithms on their own
network. Today, the TOTEM toolbox already federates a large set of traffic engineering algorithms published
in the scientific literature. The toolbox is expected to include more functionality than existing commercial
ones, and is clearly designed to be open, i.e. incrementally extensible.
